# dataStructures

This is Joohyong's(Josh) playground that contain various data structures. 


Below is the description of each codes: 

stackArray.java -----------------------------------------------------------

This code is the array implemenation of stack data structure. Ideally, this 
is FILO (First in, Last out) that is dynamically increase the capacity of 
the array when the initial capacity is reaches the limit. 

stackLinked.java ----------------------------------------------------------

This code is the linked list implemenation of stack data structure. Ideally, 
this treats the input and output by FILO(First in, Last out) that has only 
header or front of the linked list that is being used as a reference. 

arrayQueue.java -----------------------------------------------------------

This code is the array implementation of queue data structure. This treats
the input and output by FIFO(First in, Fist out) that is dynamically increase
the capacity of the array when the initial capacity is reaches the limit. 

linkedQueue.java ----------------------------------------------------------

This code is the linked list implemenation of queue data structure. Ideally, 
this treats the input and output by FIFO(First in, First out) that has only 
header & trailer or front of the linked list and rear of the linked list 
that is being used as a reference. 

BST.java ------------------------------------------------------------------

By using the node class, each node would have the two pointers, left and right. 
The root of the tree will serve as the center or origin of the tree. Left sub-tree
are less than or less prioritize than the root while right sub-tree are greater 
or greater prioritize than the root. 

BinaryTree.java -----------------------------------------------------------

Purpose of this code is to merge the two sub-tree and combine them as one 
binary tree. 

avlTree.java---------------------------------------------------------------

Purpose of this code is strictly prohibit binary search tree to be full binary 
tree. In another word, it construct the binary tree in the complete binary tree
regardless input variations.

priorityQueue (Pending)----------------------------------------------------
